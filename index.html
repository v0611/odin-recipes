    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. 
        It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, 
        made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a fresh version of lasagna that requires pre-boiling the pasta before filling it or adding sauce and then baking. 
        There are also commercial versions, 
        however, that allow for spreading the pasta in a baking pan and filling it or adding more liquid sauces so that the pasta softens during cooking. 
    </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. 
                Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
                Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. 
                Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Step 2:Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. 
                In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Step 4: to assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
                Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray 
                or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Step 5: Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. 
                Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
