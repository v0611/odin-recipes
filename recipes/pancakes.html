    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Homemade pancakes are a treat, but they are surprisingly simple to whip up. 
            Our easy pancake recipe uses ingredients you likely have on hand, like all-purpose flour, 
            baking powder, sugar, butter, and egg.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. 
                Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, oil, and egg. Mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
                Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; 
                cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
